    "section": "1.1 Why begin with Marx?",
    "text": "1.1 Why begin with Marx?\nThere are several reasons to begin with Marx. First, Marx is a representative of the transitional period in which a specifically social-scientific discourse is still struggling to differentiate itself from Philosophy. While philosophical discourses on society are as old as Plato’s Republic or Aristotle’s Politics, self consciously “scientific” discourses about society (modeled after the budding natural sciences of the day) do not emerge (in Western Europe) until the 18th century. Even then, these discourses do not reach full maturity until the middle of the nineteenth century. It would take another half-century for something like “sociology” to become institutionalized in University curricula.\nThe only figure of a comparable stature to Marx who was also struggling to create a specifically scientific discourse about society at the same time is the French philosopher Auguste Comte. Comte is in fact the originator of the term sociology, which combines a Latin first half (socius, which means society) with a Greek second half (logos, which means knowledge) The reason why we don’t begin with Comte is that Marx was actually much more successful in actually producing tangible evidence that something like an empirical sociology was possible. While Comte attempted to create an empirical sociology, his system remained much too wedded to traditional metaphysics (even though he saw his “positivist” philosophy as an attach on metaphysics).\nIn Marx, by way of contrast, we see a clearer attempt to attack the categories of Western philosophy, metaphysics and political economy as incomplete. Marx argues that the analyst must begin from empirical fact. In that respect Marx’s economic approach to history continues to be influential, while Comte’s more heavy-handed approach to history has long fallen into disfavor."

    "section": "1.2 Marx with and Against Philosophy",
    "text": "1.2 Marx with and Against Philosophy\nThis is of course not deny that Marx himself did not have strong philosophical commitments. The issue is not that Marx was not guided by those commitments, but that he felt that he also needed to point to empirical evidence to justify them. That’s what makes Marx a part of the social-scientific and not the philosophical tradition.\nWhat were the major philosophical influences on Marx? First, there is no doubt that Hegelian influences are paramount. G. F. W. Hegel is important, because he was the most influential modern philosopher to attempt to establish that history had a “logic” that could be grasped intellectually. In addition, Hegel attempted to join an abstract, philosophical theory of the origins of subjectivity in a dialectic of self and other with a theory of the way in which conceptions of the subject developed through history. In that respect, Hegel’s approach to history was heavily theoretical, teleological and “progressive.” Marx inherits all of these qualities.\nSecond, it is obvious that Marx is an heir to both the German romantic tradition and the French revolutionary tradition. In the German romantic tradition, rather than reason or rationality being the primary qualities that distinguish human from other animals, it is instead creativity that makes humans unique. Thus, creative activity (exemplified primarily by artistic and intellectual creativity but also by the creativity of the craftsman who actually molds nature into useful forms) is taken as the *model} of the most worthwhile forms of human behavior. Modern trends towards the routinization and mechanization of labor are condemned precisely because they take away the opportunity for persons to exercise creative activity. Marx’s analysis of the labor process obviously belongs to this tradition.\nFrom the French revolutionary tradition (coupled with Hegelian “progressivism”), Marx inherits a penchant to “criticize” existing institutional arrangements seen as standing in the way of the full expression of personal capacities (e.g. the organization of production under capitalism) and to formulate utopian arrangements that will liberate persons from the “shackles” of existing institutions."

    "section": "1.3 Estranged Labor",
    "text": "1.3 Estranged Labor\n\n1.3.1 Self-interest\nMarx begins by criticizing classical political economy for taking its basic categories, namely, land, labor, capital, and private property, for granted and not providing a comprehensive account of their origins and their functions. Marx also criticizes classical political economy for presupposing an exogenous set of human motivations (e.g. greed, avarice) and “the war amongst the avaricious—competition” (p. 71).\nFor Marx, greedy or selfish motivations for work and economic activity, along with the fact of competition, cannot be presupposed to be “hard-wired” into persons as a starting point for inquiry. Marx had a different theory of human nature: he thought of competition and selfishness as derivative of capitalism as an organized system. In this respect the emergence of a society of egoistic individuals competing against one another for scarce goods and the hegemony of cultural and intellectual theories that claim to derive this qualities as eternal properties of human nature must themselves be explained.\n\nFor Marx, people are just not greedy; they become greedy when embedded in a system in which greed is incentivized; competition does not just happen it must be allowed by the way in which production and exchanged are organized. ```\n\n\n\n1.3.2 The System\nMarx argues that in order for the connections between all of these factors to be understood, they must placed in the context of a wider whole or “system.” Taking any of these as exogenous begs the question as to their emergence. This apriorism makes classical (and neoclassical) economics into non-empirical, speculative “science.” In contrast to this approach, Marx proposes one in which the analyst proceeds from “empirical fact.” This last claim must of course be taken with a grain of salt. No analyst really begins from empirical fact. Instead, the construction of an analytic system requires presuppositions. Marx simply begins with different presuppositions. The difference is that he thinks his presuppositions have the added virtue of actually being supported by the relevant historical evidence, while those of classicla political economy are purely speculative.\nFor Marx, persons are not fundamentally self-interested. In fact, what makes persons unique and different for animals is the fact that naturally they take the “species” (and not their individual self) as their primary object of interest. “self-interest” is not a natural condition, but a consequence of a particular organization of production. In fact Marx argues clearly (p. 75) that it is precisely because under capitalism “man” [sic] is estranged from nature (the objects and medium of her labor) and because man is estranged from herself (in the labor process) that she comes to be focused on her individual life."

    "title": "1  Marx on Estrangement and the Labor Process",
    "section": "1.4 Alienation",
    "text": "1.4 Alienation\n\n1.4.1 Alienation From the Product of Labor\nMarx notes that the more workers produce as a class, the cheaper labor becomes. For instance, labor is cheapest in industry that produce the most “stuff” (e.g. apparel). That is, real wages can decline or stagnate even as worker productivity increases. He also notes that in this process, the very product that the laborer produces confronts the worker as itself something that is alien and that does not belong to them. Thus, the worker comes to confront the external world of objects as an alien entity that exercises a constraining power over her. This is one aspect of alienation, the “objective culture” made up of finished goods comes to swallow the human workers that participate in their production.\n\n\n1.4.2 Alienation From Activity\nIn addition to being separated and alienated from the product of their labor, the worker is also alienated from her own activity. Thus, the worker performs actions robotically and without any attachment to them. More strongly, their actions technically belongs to the capitalist, who pays for them (in the form of wages) like he does for any other factor of production. The worker thus comes to be estranged form the very act of production during the “labor process.” During work the worker is not herself, since her own activity does not “belong” to her: it belongs to the capitalist who “pays” for her labor. Thus, during work it is almost as if somebody else goes through “the motions” not the worker herself.\nAs Marx explains:\n\nWhat, then, constitutes the alienation of labour? First, the fact that labour is external to the worker, i.e., it does not belong to his essential being; that in his work, therefore, he does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical -6 and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He is at home when he is not working, and when he is working he is not at home. His labour is therefore not voluntary, but coerced; it is forced labour. It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need; it is merely a *means} to satisfy needs external to it. Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, labour is shunned like the plague. External labour, labour in which man alienates himself, is a labour of self-sacrifice, of mortification. Lastly, the external character of labour for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own, but someone else’s, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another. Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human imagination, of the human brain and the human heart, operates independently of the individual-that is, operates on him as an alien, divine or diabolical activity-in the same way the worker’s activity is not his spontaneous activity. It belongs to another; it is the loss of his self (p. 72).\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Labor under capitalism\nThe modern organization of production makes labor a means to an end. But man’s essence is to labor in a free, conscious way. That is labor is an end in itself. Laboring as a way to get something else (e.g. money or vacation) is unnatural for Marx. In the very same way “acquisitive” consumption is unnatural for Marx. He notes that private property has “made us so stupid” (p. 87) that we think that we have something only when it is possessed or directly consumed. But it is possible for something to be “ours” while at the same time being shared by others.\nPeople are different from animals in that they consciously produce their own means of subsistence. Life activity is an object of consciousness for people. Because of this, humans are the only animal that can in fact produce not for themselves, and not strictly for his or her own survival, but it can produce freely for others. Humans are the only animal that can create things that others (who are different from them) can appreciate and get a use out of.\nConsider this mystery: we have all gone shopping, and we have all found some commodity that appears to be “just for us.” How does that happen? How is it possible that somebody who has never had a direct interaction with us, is able to “guess” what we would like?\nEstranged labor thus creates a condition in which people become capable of producing only for themselves and lose their capacity and ability to produce for others. This is exemplified today in the different between planning and execution or the difference between mental and manual labor. In this division of labor the modern process of estrangement is clearly exemplified: a (small) class of producers who produce for others and a large class of producers who produce for themselves. The difference between the “real jobs” people in the “creative arts” have and their “day jobs” is also relevant here. Here we see estrangement and alienation in the same person but segregated into different times of the day or different days of the week. Production “for the species” (artistic, creative labor) is gratifying and rewarding; while “estranged production” is painful and something that can only be put up with but never truly enjoyed or found self-fulfilling.\n\n\n1.4.4 Self-estrangement and estrangement form others\nFinally, the organization of production under capitalism estranges persons from one another because it creates divisions in the social structure. For instance, if the product of my labor does not belong to me, then it belongs to somebody else. If I am not the one deciding on the “design” of the product, then someone else is. Insofar as estranged labor is a sort of distorted relation to oneself, this distorted relationship has to manifest itself in our interpersonal relations to others. Thus, insofar as the object that we produce does not belong to us and confronts us as something alien and powerful then it must belong to another person who also exerts power over us: “Every self-estrangement of man from himself and from nature appears in the relation in which he places himself and nature to men other than and differentiated from himself” (p. 78). Social divisions and the divisions between men, are thus the product of a particular organization of production.\nIn reducing work to subsistence labor and in attaching essentially competitive and selfish motivations to what should be a selfless activity, labor under capitalism estranges men from the capacity to produce freely for others, and in this (most important) respect it estranges men from the most important part of their nature, which Marx refers to as their species-being.\nOnce again, here’s is Marx:\n\nWe have considered the act of estranging practical human activity, labour, in two of its aspects. (1) The relation of the worker to the product of labour as an alien object exercising power over him. This relation is at the same time the relation to the sensuous external world, to the objects of nature as an alien world antagonistically opposed to him. (2) The relation of labour to the act of production within the labour process. This relation is the relation of the worker to his own activity as an alien activity not belonging to him; it is activity as suffering, strength as weakness, begetting as emasculating, the worker’s own physical and mental energy, his personal life or what is life other than activity-as an activity which is turned against him, neither depends on nor belongs to him. Here we have self-estrangement, as we had previously the estrangement of the thing (p. 73).\n\nPrivate property emerges as a consequence of alienated labor not its cause. The same analysis can be given of all of the other categories of political economy. Private property encapsulates both the antagonistic relation of the worker to himself (the product of his labor) as dual to the relationship between the worker and the non-worker (capitalist).\nThis is part of Marx’s attempt to turn the assumptions of classical political economy on their head. Rather than assume that persons are “naturally” selfish, selfishness is derived as a consequence of the organization of production under capitalism.Rather than assume that persons are in a natural state of competition against one another, competition is derived as a result of the estrangement of persons from one another (the third form of estrangement) under capitalism.Rather than presume that the mechanization and routinization of labor are natural, they are derived as the inevitable result of the competition for profit on the part of capitalists. Finally (and most controversially) rather than presume that private property is a primitive, the institution of private property is derived as a consequence of a class division between those who only have their wages to sell, and those who “buy” labor power in an open market."

    "section": "2.1 Finding logic in history",
    "text": "2.1 Finding logic in history\nMarx was certainly not the first, but has certainly been the most influential of the modern thinkers that has tried to understand the “logic” of history. This has been a very seductive idea in the history of social thought and has been expressed in both religious (e.g. theological) and secular formulations. For instance, on the religious side, the conception of a progression of human history from a pristine state, to the “fall” to a future redemption was dominant in the Christian West.\nIn the eighteenth century, the rise of “enlightenment” philosophy produced the first influential version of a secular theory of history progression which proclaimed the past (the medieval dark ages) as an epoch ruled by error and superstition and saw the future as one of progress governed by reason. This is why the period is classically known as “The Age of Reason.”\nWith Marx the notion of a logic of history passes from philosophical speculation into the realm of social science. The faith that human history follows a decipherable logic makes Marx a “progressive” thinker. This contrasts to thinkers who see history as simply a random collection of events with no rhyme or reason or those who see history as following a logic, but one of decline rather than progress.\nMarx acquired the penchant of understanding human historical progress through a conceptual lens offered by Hegelian philosophy. In Hegel, history could be understood as the gradual progression of cultural “epochs” or periods. These periods were characterized by the dominance of particular conceptions or ideas which defined social relationships, institutions and even religious notions. Hegel’s mature philosophy came to be perceived as a “conservative” ideology for the fledgling unification government in Germany. For Hegel the “logic” of the history of ideas and political and social forms “culminated” in the aristocratic quasi-democracy of the Prussian state.\nMarx was part of a group of intellectuals in Germany in the 1830s and 1840s that came to be known as the Young Hegelians. These intellectuals rejected the conservative cast of official Hegelianism while retaining the basic conceptual apparatus. Some of the young Hegelians used Hegel’ own dialectical method and his reflections on the origins of subjectivity as a form of “alienation” to mount a radical attack against traditional Christianity.\nMarx, like the rest of the young Hegelians was enthusiastic about the “critical” project, but he rejected the residual idealism of Ludwig Feuerbach (the most influential of the Young Hegelians), for a sociologically flavored concern with how persons “produce” their being as part of attempting to subsist. Marx also retained the ambition to understand the logic that governed the transition from one historical period to the next.\nMarx’s most lasting innovation is his proposition that the “logic” of historical progression lies not in ideas or cultural forms, but in concrete and very much material “modes” for the organization of economic production. This follows from his rock-bottom assumption that the essence of human beings (what makes them different from animals) is the capacity to produce their own mode of subsistence. For Marx, it was innovation and revolutions at the level of the productive forces (productive technology and the relations of production characteristic of an epoch) in which the secret to understanding the logic of history could be found."

They are the material forces that generate production. These include tools, machinery, technology, factories, etc.\nThe relations of production are the relations in which persons enter into in order to produce their means of subsistence (e.g. wage labor, serfdom, slavery, cooperation, etc.).\n\nPolitical and legal institutions are designed to regulate both the acceptable ways of organizing production and even the acceptable uses of technology for the production of goods as well as the forms of the distribution, exchange and consumption of goods.\nFinally, ideology and forms of consciousness emerge to make sense of and justify some existing way of organizing production."

    "section": "2.3 Understanding Historical Change",
    "text": "2.3 Understanding Historical Change\nMarx emphasizes that in order to understand the progression of historical stages, we must understand economic development. That is, because society is the result of reciprocal action among persons any one individual cannot choose the form of society that he she lives in. This means that a given state of the productive “forces” or faculties general fixes the form of commerce and consumption of society. Production, commerce and consumption in their turn fixes the constitution of civil society (e.g. politics, family life, classes, etc.).\nPersons do not choose the productive forces of the society, and they can do very little to alter them as individuals. Historically, men are born into and encounter a certain state of the productive forces of society which serve as a constraint and as a point of departure for further development. The productive forces determine the type of material relations that men can enter into with another, and “[t]heir material relations are the basis of all their relations. These material relations are only the necessary forms in which their material and individual activity are realized” (p. 137).\nEconomic relations are secondary to the particular state of development of the productive forces. Once there is a change in the specific material mode in which men produce their subsistence, the older economic institutions and the social relations premised upon them must change (“burst”) in turn. Thus, Marx explains the demise of the medieval guild system in England as a result of the technological development and the expansion of commercial activity: “…as men [sic] develop their productive faculties, that is, as they live, they develop certain relations with one another…the nature of these relations must necessarily change with the change and growth of the productive faculties” (p. 140).\nTo each economic epoch, Marx notes there exist a particular coupling between a given way of organizing production (a “division of labor”) and a particular state of technology. These are concrete historical forms and not abstract a-temporal “economic categories.” Thus, for Marx, there is no such thing as “The Division of Labor” in general or “machinery” in general, but specific forms of the division of labor (which correspond to a given state of development of the productive forces of a given society) or a specific state of development of productive technology. To state otherwise is to commit the idealistic fallacy of reification of historical realities into abstract economic forms.\nFor Marx, persons produce not only material products, but they produce the social relations under which production takes place and they produce they idea with which they make sense of and legitimize a given organization of production. There is no dualism between material and ideal, since both are the product of human activity."

These is the thesis of correspondence between relations of production and productive forces.\n“The sum total of these relations of production constitute the economic structure of society.” Economic structure = relations of production + productive forces.\nThe economic structure of society is the “real” foundation upon which a “superstructure” composed of legal and political institutions and “forms of social consciousness” rests.\n“The mode of production [economic structure] of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual process in general” (p. 4).\nThis is the thesis of the conditioning role of the economic structure in relation to the superstructure.\n\n\n\n2.4.2 The base/superstructure conflict-model of historical change\n\n“At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production, or—what is but a legal expression of the same thing—with the property relations within which they have been at work hitherto” (p. 4).\nThis is the thesis of the uneven development of the productive forces in relation to the relations of production and the superstructure.\nIn a certain respect Marx is arguing that the productive forces change at a faster rate than the relations of production and the legal arrangement that support them both of which tend to lag behind.\nThese now obsolete relations of production are not only lagging behind, but begin to constitute an impediment to the further development of the productive forces: “…these relations turn into their fetters” (p. 4-5).\nThis situation can only be resolved through a revolutionary change in which new relations of production are devised which better “fit” the new forces of production.\n“Then begins an epoch of social revolution. With the change of economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed” (p. 5).\nMarx argues that technological transformations should be kept distinct from its accompanying “ideological”, legal or cultural transformations. The former “can be determined with the precision of natural science,” while the latter tend to (presumably) be much more slippery, messy and harder to pin down.\nMarx did not think that looking at cultural transformations was a good way to estimate whether a period of revolution was on its way; instead it is more accurate to look at “the contradictions of material life” especially the tensions between “productive forces” and “relations of production.”\nIn this respect Marx makes two observations:\n\n\nFirst, “no social order ever perishes before all the productive forces for which there is room in it have developed” (p. 5).\nSecond, “new, higher relations of production never appear before the material conditions of their existence have matured in the womb of the old society itself” (p. 5)."

    "section": "3.1 The Bourgeoisie as a Revolutionary Class",
    "text": "3.1 The Bourgeoisie as a Revolutionary Class\nIn the first part of “The Manifesto of the Communist Party” Marx provides a panoramic, and to this day unsurpassed description of the passage from Feudalism to capitalism, the revolutionary role of the bourgeoisie in facilitating this revolution and the revolutionary features that make capitalism a unique epoch in world history.\nSomething that might be surprising for some here is that Marx here appears to be in favor of capitalism. Marx was of course against the social ills produced by capitalism in his time (impoverishment of the Proletariat, exploitation, social dislocation, etc.), but also conceived of capitalism as a necessary stage towards a better more humane social and economy system. Thus, however negative the advent of capitalism and the destruction of medieval society in Europe was something to be celebrated as progressive. Capitalism is bad, but traditional medieval society was even worse.\nMarx opens with his famous statement: “The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles” (473). This is considered the basic principle of historical materialism. People enter into class relations in producing their means of subsistence, and history can be read as a succession of conflicts between persons located in different positions in the production process.\nMarx notes that a key feature of capitalism is the radical simplification of the class struggle:\n\nIn the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders a manifold gradation of social rank[]Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms: Society as a whole is more and more splitting into two great hostile camps, into two great classes facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat (p. 474).\n\nMarx goes on to detail how the modern Bourgeoisie emerges from the merchant classes of the medieval city. As world capitalism grows with the integration of Europe into the Asian trade routes and the discovery of America, the old feudal system topples under the pressure to keep up with expanding markets and increasing demands. This leads to the dissolution of feudal systems of production and their replacement by the factory system, and later the mechanization and the industrialization of the production process. This gives rise to large scale industry and to the modern bourgeoisie as we understand it: “[w]e see, therefore how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and exchange. Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class” (p. 475, italics added).\nMarx observes that throughout this development the bourgeoisie has evolved from a politically powerless class under the feudal nobility, to “an armed and self-governing association in the medieval commune,” to independent urban republics in the Italian city-states to an ally of the great eighteenth and nineteenth century monarchies, and finally “since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world-market” to being the politically dominant class in representative democracy systems: “[t]he executive of the modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie” (p. 475)."

It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his natural superiors, and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous `cash payment’ (p. 475).\nThe Bourgeoisie has eliminated older traditions based on religion and sentiment and has replaced it with cold calculation based on monetary payments; it “has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation.”\n\nThe Bourgeoisie has “resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom—Free Trade” (p. 475).\nIn one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation” (p. 475).\nThe Bourgeoisie has removed the ancient privileges and charismatic mystifications that attached to certain venerated occupations in the past. Instead, “it has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage laborers” (p. 476). > The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation” (p. 476).\nThe bourgeoisie has surpassed medieval classes in both activity and accomplishments: > The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigor of the middle ages{found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence. It has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, Gothic cathedrals. It has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former exoduses of nations (p. 476).\nThe bourgeoisie is on the side of constant technological change: > The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the means of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind (p. 476)."

It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere” (p. 476).\nThe bourgeoisie is a primary agent of globalization: “The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world-market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country. To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood” (p. 476).\nGlobalization spurs the creation of new tastes: “In place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes” (p. 476).\nGlobalization spells the end of localism:\n\n“In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations” (p. 476).\n“The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication draws all, even the most barbarian nations into civilization” (p. 477).\n\nThe bourgeoisie spreads capitalism across the entire globe:\n\n“It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilization into their midst, i.e. to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its own image” (p. 477).\n\nCosmopolitanism emerges for both material and cultural production: “And as in material so also in intellectual production. The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible, and form the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature (p. 476-477).\nThe bourgeoisie is an agent of urbanization: “it has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life” (p. 477).\nThe bourgeoisie is an agent of colonization and of asymmetric economic relations across regions: “[j]ust as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilized ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West” (p. 477).\nThe bourgeoisie is an agent of political centralization and social homogenization; it “keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of the means of production, and of property. It has agglomerated population, centralized means of production, and has concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence of this was political centralization” (p. 477)."

    "text": "3.4 Marxian metaphors\nSome of the main ways in which Marx understood social and historical change were rendered via metaphors. The following are some of the most important metaphors used by Marx.\n\n3.4.1 Specters, ghosts, phantasms\nMarx referred to communism as a ghost or specter that was haunting Europe. “A specter is haunting Europe: the specter of communism” (p. 473).\n\n\n3.4.2 Melting and Veiling\nMarx thought of capitalism as a revolutionary force that did away with the culture and habits of the ancien regime. He usually used the metaphor of melting away to refer to this process, in particular in the classic passage that begins: “All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and men at last are forced to face with sober senses the real conditions of their lives and their relation with their fellow men.” In this passage Marx conceives of the older traditional culture of European societies based on tradition and hierarchy as a veil that prevented persons for seeing one another for what they were. Capitalism destroys tradition and frees persons to consider one another simply as human beings who work for a living without any distortions.\n\n\n3.4.3 Tearing\nMarx used the metaphor of tearing to refer to consequences of capitalist development, that, while seemingly negative, actually heralded a positive development. This “tearing” was especially poignant as it concerned the effect of capitalism upon traditional views of social relationships and the family. Thus, for Marx, capitalism has “torn asunder the motley feudal ties” that connected persons to one another under the old regime (p. 475). It has also “torn away from the family its sentimental veil” (p. 476)."

    "section": "4.1 How Much is Work Worth?",
    "text": "4.1 How Much is Work Worth?\nThe first question that Marx takes up in this text is the issue of the origins and determination of wages. He begins by evoking a simple scenario in which a worker is asked where his or her wages come from. Marx notes that when confronted with such a question a worker will simply reply by noting how much money they receive from their employer at each given day.\nMarx notes that this gives the impression that the employer is buying their labor, an abstract substance, with money, while the employee is simply selling their labor in exchange for money. Marx rejects this formulation as simply an “appearance” (p. 204).\nInstead, what the employer is doing is buying labor power, which is put to use by the capitalist for a given period of time. But the capitalist could have used the money that he is paying the worker to buy some other commodity; this makes labor power substitutable for those alternative things that the capitalist could have spent his or her money on. Thus, “[l]abour power, therefore, is a commodity, neither more nor less than sugar. The former is measured by the clock, the latter by the scales” (p. 204).\nMarx goes on to reiterate the analysis of alienation as formulated in the Paris Manuscripts of 1844, where the analysis of estrangement ad alineation comes from. Labor is the person’s very life activity, which they are compelled to sell to the capitalist, in transforming their own life-activity into commodities, persons are estranged from it: “the product of his activity, is not the object of hist activity” (p. 205).\nMarx notes that capitalism institutes a strange indirect relationship between the worker, their life activity and the product of her labor. In capitalism, this connection is mediated by wages on both ends. On the production side, the relationship between worker and capitalist is mediated by the exchange of labor power for wages. On the consumption side, the relationship between the worker and commodities on the market are mediated by the prices of these commodities, and by the amount of each that the worker can afford (as fixed by their wages).\nMarx mentions that beyond the supply and demand fluctuations in the price of labor produced by competition on both sides of the boundary (e.g. competition between employers for workers and competition between potential workers for jobs), on average the price of labor will be equal to the “cost of production” of labor power. The cost of production of labor power is the “cost required for maintaining the worker as a worker and of developing him into a worker” (p. 206). This cost is, excluding for the sake of simplicity training costs, essentially the same as the price of the commodities necessary to keep the worker “alive and capable of working” (p. 206). We should also add to this the cost of “reproduction” that is, the costs necessary to replace “worn-out workers by new ones.” Wages so determined are referred to by Marx as the wage minimum."

    "section": "4.2 What is Capital?",
    "text": "4.2 What is Capital?\nMarx criticizes the traditional essentialist definition of capital on the part of political economists. According to this definition, capital is simply labor as accumulated in (extracted) raw materials, (usable) land and machinery. Marx argues on the other hand that capital becomes capital only when embedded in certain relations.\nMarx points out that these relations of production vary according to the particular state of the productive forces, as he an Engels had noted in The German Ideology (p. 207).\nMarx argues that the Capital-Labor relation just so happens to be the relation of production characteristic to the bourgeois mode of production (capitalism). Because under capitalism there is a market for all of the “factors” of production (labor, raw materials, machinery, land, etc.), and thus everything is in principle exchangeable for everything else, capital can be thought of as a bundle of exchange values. The value of commodities is simply the ratio at which they can be exchanged for another, which for convenience sake can be expressed in money as their price.\nMarx is now in a position to define capital. A given set of exchange values in the form of “accumulated labor” functions as capital when there exists a majority of persons who are denied ownership of those values, and must thus exchange their labor power for a small piece of the surplus produced by activation of that capital through the action of living labor (labor power). Capital is thus not an entity defined by an intrinsic essence, but an essentially relational object. It only exists insofar as a bulk of workers exist that must sell their labor power for a wage."

There it is a social relation between men, that assumes, in their eyes the fantastic form of a relation between thing’’ (p. 321).\n\n\nSince the producers do not come into social contact with each other until they exchange their products, the specific social character of each producer’s labor does not show itself except in the act of exchange (p. 321).\n\n\n[W]henever, by an exchange, we equate as values our different products, by that very act, we also equate, as human labor the different kinds of labor expended upon them.

    "text": "5.1 After Marx\nMarx lays out the fundamental set of problems, questions and issues that will be taken up by the second generation of social theorists who came of age after him. Marx himself died destitute in London in 1883. His subsequent influence on academic sociology was not direct, but was mediated by the major figures who had to deal with his intellectual legacy in Germany and France: Max Weber, Emile Durkheim and Georg Simmel.\nWhat are the main set of unresolved issues that Marx’s left for the next generation? First there’s the problem of modernity and modernization, in particular the social, cultural, political and economic consequences of modernity. Second, there is the problem of capitalism. We will see that Weber, Simmel and Durkheim attack these problems in their own way. They do so by a critical engagement with the Marxian legacy. This engagement is critical because it attempts to address the major weakness of the Marxian system of explanation: the neglect of culture, values and meaning and the relative neglect of issues of authority, community, association and solidarity. This is why in both Weber and Durkheim, religion emerges as a major issue. Weber in particular takes up a question that did not bother Marx too much: this is the issue of the cultural specificity of the West.\nWeber begins by outlining his “big” question: “What combination of circumstances led in the West, only in the West, to the appearance of a variety of cultural phenomena that stand…in a historical line of development with universal significance and empirical validity?”\nProviding an answer to this question was the main motivation behind essentially the entirety of Weber’s work."

    "section": "5.2 Is the West special?",
    "text": "5.2 Is the West special?\nNote that the very phrasing of this question presupposes a “politically incorrect” premise: that Western culture is indeed unique or stands apart from other cultures and civilizations. Weber certainly believed this and it is the purpose of this essay to outline a series of empirical facts that demonstrate this uniqueness. What are this facts?\n\n5.2.1 Natural Science\n\nFirst, science and the emergence of specifically rational systems of mathematics and theology are primarily a creature of Western culture. The application of mathematics to understanding the empirical world is also unique to the West. This is the line of cultural development that culminates in modern Physics and Chemistry. Both of these sciences are essentially of Wester origin.\n\nThe notion of logical “proof” was not present outside of the West and is unique to the tradition that begins with the Greeks. The rational experiment was essentially absent from Eastern traditions and the modern laboratory is in fact an invention of Western scientists. The rational experiment is the fundamental tool of modern science; without it cumulative empirical progress is impossible.\nA rational medicine and a rational chemistry was essentially absent outside of the West. Western medicine is analytical and based on the decomposition of the body and its organs as part of a mechanism. Eastern medicine is holistic and based on the notion of the body as an organismic “field” not decomposable into elements. The notions of “surgery” as a way to correct illness or the notion of distinct “functions” of various bodily organs is unique to the Western “mechanistic” outlook.\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Law and Political Science\nOnly in the West do essentially rational systems of thought regarding society and the state emerge. These of course culminate in modern political theory, political science, sociology and today management and information science. While systems of thought regarding politics and society exist outside the West, all “omitted a systematic approach comparable to Aristotle’s, as well as rational concepts in general.”\nOnly in the West do we have systems of rational law. Religious, traditional and so-called “Common Law” systems are of course universal, but only in the West does a tradition of rational jurisprudence emerge. Rational jurisprudence is distinct in that it is founded on fundamental principles and axioms and in that there are rational procedures for both the application and the modification of law. Only in the West does rational “Canon Law” emerge.\n\n\n5.2.3 Music and Art\nIn the realm of art, the West stands out as distinctive. First, rational harmonic music and the development of a rational musical notation are known only in the West. The rationalization of the visual arts in the form of the incorporation of linear and spatial perspective is unique to Renaissance art. Particular architectural innovations using rational solutions to certain engineering problems (e.g. domes and the Gothic vault) appear only in the West.\n\n\n5.2.4 Literature and the production of knowledge\nPrinting existed in both East and West, but a print culture including printed literature designed for the sole purpose of being printed emerges only in the West.\nUniversities are not exclusive to the West. However, the modern university system organized around departments and “disciplines” and featuring specialization along those lines exists only in the West.\n\n\n5.2.5 Civil service, politics and rational bureaucracy\nThe particular structure of Government organized around the figure of “The Civil Servant” can be found in many civilizations. Nevertheless, “[o]nly in the modern West is our entire existence—the foundational political, technical, and economic conditions of our being—absolutely and inescapably bound up in the casing (Gehause) of an organization of specially trained civil servants.”\nCivil servants and civil service institutions in the public sector have existed in all civilizations, jowever, only in the West is this structure extended to all areas of government action and has carried the specialization and training in “technical, commercial, and, above all legal areas of knowledge who are the social carriers of the most important everyday functions of social life” (p. 207) to the extent to be found in the West\nA specific form of parliamentary democracy is unique to the political life of the West. Status groups have existed in all civilizations, but only in the West do they appear as the bearer of specific political rights of representation. Thus, the peculiar fact of divided political domination, premised on an always precarious compromise between “estates,” is found only in the West. In all other societies estates were subordinate to the King or the emperor in the West the division of society into estates and the political influence gained by independent segments of civil society, produces the foundations of parliamentary democracy. In all societies there are permanent organization dedicated to the pursuit of political power (parties), but only in the West do we find the specific combination of the state as a purely “political institution…operated according to rationally enacted”constitution” and rationally enacted laws, and administered by civil servants possessing specialized arenas of competence and oriented to rules and “laws.”"

    "section": "5.3 The Uniqueness of Rational Capitalism",
    "text": "5.3 The Uniqueness of Rational Capitalism\nWeber goes through great pains to differentiate non-rational forms of capitalism from rational capitalism. He even notes that “capitalism” as the pursuit of riches or economic advantage is not historically unique to the West, and that various things that have been thought to be essential to capitalism can easily be shown to be found in all of its historical instances in every civilization.\nTo begin with, the “drive to acquire goods” and the “pursuit of profit,” money, and the greatest possible gain” have nothing to do with capitalism. This attitude can be found across the entire range of social and occupational strata. It has existed “in all epochs, and in all countries of the glob” it is not historically unique or culturally distinctive. Instead, Weber argues that “[t]his naive manner of conceptualizing capitalism by reference to a”pursuit of gain” must be relegated to the kindergarten of cultural history…and abandoned once and for all. The unbridled pursuit of wealth and riches is not equivalent to capitalism, nor is it the essence of its mentality. Instead what may be distinctive of Western capitalism may instead be a taming of the unbridled, uncontrolled tendency to accumulate profit. In modern, rational capitalism “profit is pursued in a rational, continuous manner…and then pursued again and again, as is profitability.”\n\n5.3.1 Key features of rational capitalism\nWhat are the distinctive features of the Western capitalist enterprise?\n\nRational capitalism can be defined as “an expectation of profit based on the utilization of opportunities for exchange; that is, of (formally) peaceful opportunities for acquisition.”\nRational capitalism is characterized by an action-orientation towards calculation via rational accounting (Double-Entry Bookkeeping). Here the calculation of balances is crucial. Profit must constantly be found to exceeds costs. This is not necessarily dependent on the existence of monetary currency. Under this definition, rational capitalism has existed at all time and in all civilizations. But only in the West has this form of capitalism gone from being an isolated or institutionally buffered set of activities to be the dominant force of our time.\nThis orientation is characterized by the establishment of permanent enterprises for the pursuit of profit. This contrasts to the orientation toward short-term profits of pre-rational forms of capitalism.\nForms of capitalism that have almost all of the ingredients as rational capitalism (they exhibit permanence and the rational pursuit of profit) have existed in all times and ages. This type of capitalism uses warfare, colonialism and other forms of political and military coercion to generate profit-making opportunities. While this sort of capitalism is rational “at the top” it remains irrational in its dependence on political coercion, military violence and pre-rational forms of the organization of labor (slavery, plantations, etc.) at the “bottom.” Weber called it adventure capitalism.\nThe use of (formally) free labor is one of the key defining features of the rational form of capitalism characteristic of the modern West. Only in the West, does something like a class of “free” laborers persons who have nothing but their labor power to sell in the open market has existed. This means that the pure type of naked class struggles between property owners and property-less workers is unique to the West. Thus, not only capitalism but modern socialism is a uniquely Western entity.\n\nThe separation of business activity from the household economy is a major feature of rational capitalism, other forms of capitalism the (private) enterprise is always an extension of the family business and the finances are not kept separate.\n\nRational capitalism was also aided by similar forms of rationalization outside the economy, specially in terms of: - The Rational organization of work. For Weber, only formally “free labor” (as described by Marx) constitutes a rational way or organizing labor. Other pre-capitalist forms (slavery, serfdom, etc.) constitute irrational elements preventing the rise of Rational Capitalism, even when other elements are there. - The rational application of scientific discoveries and technological developments to economic pursuits. - The development of rational Law and Administration. All of these help the rational capitalist do something that is crucial for the rational administration of the business enterprise which is to be able to calculate risks and benefits far into the future.\nWhile economic rationalism definitely helped in spreading this rationalist attitude, Weber notes that this rationalism is at the same time part of a larger cultural trend of rationalization in all areas of life. Thus, part of the answer to Weber’s “big question” has to do with the development of a particular type of life conduct oriented to rational action in the secular world only in the West."

    "text": "6.1 Why do people do the things they do?\nA key problem for Max Weber concerns the motivation for human action. This was not a problem for Marx, because he had a strong theory of human nature that answered that question for him (persons are motivated to produce their means of subsistence through creative activity). For Weber on the other hand, human nature is culturally pliable and thus motivations are culturally arbitrary (and thus problematic).\nWeber focuses on religion because he sees this life sphere as being primary in terms of setting down fundamental motivations for human action (other life spheres like the economy actually inherit motivational templates from the religious one as we will see later). Weber sees the quest for salvation as the prototypical example of motivated action. For Weber unmotivated action is not social action, while motivated action is inherently social.\nReligious action is motivated action because it is action that is done with an explicit purpose in mind. In so-called “salvation” religions this purposive nature of religious conduct is brought to the fore with clarity. For instance the purpose of ritual can be the “cleansing” of the person from sin, or the production of a particular mood."

    "section": "6.2 Material versus Ideal Interests",
    "text": "6.2 Material versus Ideal Interests\nThe key difference between Marx and Weber concerns the substantive content of motivation. For Weber, the standard Marxian account is concerned exclusively with action motivated by what he refers to as material interests. The Marxian model in which action and ideas are directly determined by social position “works” because in the case of material interests there is a one-to-one correspondence between interests and position, so the analyst can “predict” one from the other. Weber is interested instead in cases in which action appears to be motivated by ideal interests. Ideal interests appear irrational from a Marxian model because they seem to go against the person’s material interests.\nIdeal interests for instance, are involved in action that is clearly altruistic or that leads the person to forgo material advantage. Ideal interests are also involved in action that, while being “self interested” (e.g. the quest for salvation) requires otherwise inexplicable (and sometime extreme) sacrifices of material and social goods. When confronted with cases in which action is motivated by ideal interests, the analyst cannot engage in the Marxian heuristic of reading the motivation of action directly from the requirements imposed by objective social position. Instead, when dealing with ideal interests the analyst must engage in the rational reconstruction of the motivation of action, or else deem the action “irrational.” For Weber, such a charitable reconstruction of action as rational necessarily involve reference to the analytically independent power of ideas as a sui generis motivator of action, not simply as a reflection of social position."

    "section": "6.3 Religion and Life Conduct",
    "text": "6.3 Religion and Life Conduct\nWeber thought that he could use the different motivations for action evident in the history of the world religions to show that ideas had a specific effect on the direction of action. For instance, different religions set up different “accounting systems” for the achievement of salvation. Some like Zoroastrianism, good and bad actions independently of one another, giving more important to the “net total” achieved during the person’s lifetime. Others, like ascetic Protestantism enforce a strict accounting where no deviation is allowed. Medieval Catholicism enforces a ritualistic cleansing of bad actions as mediated by the ritual of confession officiated by the priest, and so on.\nThe social consequences of a given religious system for action outside of the religious realm depend on how the path to salvation is defined. For instance extreme ritualism (e.g., Hinduism) depresses rational economic action. In this respect extreme ritualism is the opposite of puritan asceticism.\nRitualism of any kind can also depress rational activity because its consequences do not “carry over” to other realms; they are simply meant to produce short-term “moods.” When ritualism does become a consistent part of a person’s everyday existence it usually leads to mysticism.\nThe goal of salvation can lead to all kinds of action performances, including sacrifice in battle, schooling, and the performance of “good works.” In this way, religious motivations may carry over into other realms or spheres of life.\nAn ethic of good works leads to a logic of “accounting” but it does not lead to the systematization of ethical action: instead “the conduct of life remains, from the viewpoint of ethics, and unmethodical and miscellaneous succession of discrete actions” (p. 155).\nThe primary goal of most religious activity is the attainment of a particular ethical or emotional state. When God is conceptualized as being immanent to the world (or in religious without a transcendental God), the goal of religious activity is ethical self perfection and self-deification. In religions with a transcendental God (a deity that is seen as separate and outside the world), the goal of religious activity “must become the acquisition of those religious qualities the god demands in men” (p. 159).\nThe primary problem of all salvation religions, according to Weber, is the problem of certainty. Essentially the question of “how do you know for sure that you are saved” becomes the primary observation of believers. This leads persons to an endless quest for a particular psychological state that Weber refers to as certitudo salutis (the certainty or assurance of grace). Weber sees most of the extreme forms of religious practices as being means to the attainment of this psychological state:\n\nThus, all of these methodologies of sanctification developed a combined physical and psychic regimen and an equally methodical regulation of the manner and scope of thought and action, thus producing in the individual the most completely alert, voluntary, and anti-instinctual control over his [sic] own physical and psychological processes, and insuring teh systematic regulation of life in subordination to the religious end (p. 162).\n\nAny religion that sets up “requirements” and “procedures” for salvation, also generates a “stratification” or “differentiation” of persons based on their ability to meet those requirements (p. 162). One of the most common “methodical techniques” of religion to create differentiation are those that recommend “the transcendence of particular desires and emotions of raw human nature.” This differentiates between persons who are able to do that (and thus acquire charisma) and the rest who cannot do those particular extraordinary actions.\nWeber notes that a particular way of thinking about what it takes to achieve salvation leads to an attitude that he calls ascetic in this case salvation is “viewed as the distinctive gift of active ethical behavior performed in the awareness that god directs this behavior” (p. 164)."

Weber reasoned that the best way to demonstrate this effect of ideas on social action was through the analysis of lines of conduct that would appear to be irrational if it were not for our capacity to reconstruct the motivations for that type of action by appealing to the person’s belief system. For this assignment, I want you to take a piece of behavior that is seemingly irrational, and make it understandable by reconstructing the actors motivation and their belief system. Make sure to be specific and to pay attention to the details of your example."

    "text": "7.1 Elementary Forms of Religious Action\nWeber’s first substantive point is that “the most elementary forms” of religious behavior rather than being oriented to the supernatural are instead primarily oriented towards mundane, worldly concerns, such as health, finances, crops, etc.\nThis makes elementary religious action a type of “rational” action even though it does not quite fit the means-end action schema: “Thus, religious or magical behavior or thinking must not be set apart from the range of everyday purposive conduct, particularly since even the ends of the religious and magical actions are predominantly economic.”\nFor Weber, the most elementary form of religious action is magic. Magic is rational, because it is designed to produce effects, gets things done and satisfy needs and desires. With magic, and by means of a magician, persons attempt to influence natural and supernatural powers to get what they want.\nWeber notes that it is illicit to judge magical action according to the standards of modern science. Instead from the point of view of those who believe in the effects of magical acts and perform those acts themselves the relevant distinction is between ordinary phenomena and those of an unusual or extraordinary nature. While the former do not require magic, the latter do."

    "text": "7.2 Charisma and Religion\nBelief in the effectiveness of magic requires a conceptualization of a power that is responsible for the effect. Weber notes that various cultures have terms for such powers (e.g. mana, orenda, maga, etc.). He uses the term “charisma” to refer to the same set of notions.\nCharisma can be of two types: “ascriptive” or “achieved” (these are not Weber’s own terms). Ascriptive charisma is seen as inherent in the person or object and is not transferable. Achieved charisma can be produced through the deployment of “extraordinary means.”\nFor Weber, the first act of religious abstraction consists in the separation of the charisma of persons or objects from their material manifestation, so that their efficacious power is now seen as emanating from an invisible quasi-personal being or force which can enter or be linked to otherwise mundane objects and persons: “this is the belief in spirits” (italics mine)."

Instead, Weber notes that the belief in spirits is more likely a product of the development of the “full-time magician” as a vocation. Full-time magicians are persons thought to be endowed with permanent charisma and thus with an ability to control or channel spiritual forces. They are thus the first ones to engage in “the rational manipulation of spirits in accordance with economic interests.”\nThe magician’s charisma is usually thought to reside in his or her ability to achieve a particular psychological state unavailable to the layman through means that are usually kept “secret” from them. The magician is distinct because he is the first “professional” to set up a continuous enterprise of which he is a self-appointed indispensable member.\nThe concept of the soul, according to Weber develops directly from the professional practice of the magician. This is thought to be “a separate entity present in, behind or near natural objects.”"

    "text": "7.4 The Rationalization of Religious Belief\nSpirits can be thought of in two ways. First, they may be thought of as entities that can dwell or enter objects or persons thus coming to affect their behavior and endow them with special powers; this is the naturalistic conception of spirits. Second, they may be thought of as “invisible essences that follow their own laws” and which are simply “symbolized” by concrete objects. This is the abstract conception of spirits. The trend in religious evolution is for naturalism to be supplanted with abstract symbolism. T he next stage in religious evolution is the development of permanent Gods and Demons endowed with their own personality and individuality. This requires some work, since initially most Gods are impersonal or indistinguishable from the natural forces that are associated with them and very few are endowed with permanent sites or worship or are even conceived in the same way over time.\nInitially we may see some personalization when names of famous chiefs or warriors come to be attached to some spirits. However, even with the emergence of individualization, the emergence of a permanent cult is still highly contingent on social circumstances and is not foreordained in advance. Be that as it may, the next stage is certainly the one in which impersonal forces and spirits are transformed into personal “souls” and individualized “Gods” and “Demons.”"

    "text": "7.5 The Magicalization of the World\nThis development has profound consequences. First, since the supernatural realm that comes to be populated with them is invisible, a whole set of “symbolic” techniques and technology must be developed to regulate communication between Gods and persons, these include those communications designed to influence the Gods to further individual and collective interests: “this is done through actions that address themselves to a spirit or soul, hence done by instrumentalities that”mean” something, i.e., symbols. Thereafter, naturalism may be swept away by a flood of symbolic actions.” This is the magicalization of the world.\nThis “proliferation of symbolic acts and their supplanting of the original naturalism” has a series of important consequences for the evolution of culture. Primarily this represents an advance towards rationalization and the elimination of certain irrational consequences that resulted from the concreteness of naturalistic thinking (e.g. the example of the dead and their possessions).\nHowever, the emergence of “action symbolism” also results in irrational consequences in particular the emergence of “orthopraxy” and tradition. Because success comes to be tied to the exact replication of the original act that was thought to be efficacious, deviations from established practice come to be condemned as sacrilegious and as deserving of punishment. Thus, “the first and fundamental effect of religious views upon the conduct of life and therefore upon economic activity was generally stereotyping…*To the natural uncertainties and resistances of every innovator, religion thus adds powerful impediments of its own. The sacred is uniquely unalterable” (a position that is compatible with Durkheim’s)."

    "text": "7.6 The Rationalization of Religion (the De-Magicalization of the World)\nThe end of naturalism and the establishment of permanent cults dedicated to the worship of “abstract” Gods, leads professional magicians to evolve into permanent keepers of the cult and to be begin the process of the rationalization of doctrine and belief. Here rationalization is the systematic organization of religious ideas. Initially all cults begin as pre-rationalized, disorganized “miscellany of accidental entities held together fortuitously by the cult.” Once a full-time set of religious professionals is in place however, “there is generally a tendency for a pantheon to evolve…This entails, on the one hand, the specialization and the fixed characterization of particular gods and, on the other, the allocation to them of constant attributes and differentiated responsibilities.”\nWeber then goes on to engage in one of his classic analyses of the “spillover” of religion onto other domains. He does this by deriving a particular sort of legalistic thinking about the (secular) consequences of every type of action, from the Roman concern with the casuistry of their various activities. Because the Roman pantheon consisted of an almost innumerable panoply of (official and unofficial) deities, of which claimed a particular jurisdiction and each of which had to be taken into account (in order to be satisfied) in the performance of even the most mundane of acts, Roman religious culture “had the effect of producing a conceptual analysis of all individual actions into their components, each being assigned to the jurisdiction of a particular numen whose special protection it enjoyed.” In this way a pattern of action developed in the religious realm, “sacred law” ends up becoming “the mother of rational juristic thinking.”"

    "text": "8.1 What is the Mentality of Capitalism?\nWeber begins by noting that the spirit of capitalism cannot be defined before-hand. Instead its full definition must be provided piece by piece and can only come at the end of the investigation. The reason for this is that the mentality of capitalism is a historically unique object which cannot be defined in the classical manner.\nWeber then goes on to provide an example of the Spirit of Capitalism in the form of Benjamin Franklyn’s maxims. Weber notes that the main difference between Franklyn’s maxims and the idea of “greed” is the obvious moral content of the maxims. Here saving money and appearing credit worthy are not just expedient things to do; they are the right thing to do: they are a duty.\nWeber notes that the spirit of capitalism can be thought of as “an ethically-oriented maxim for the organization of life” (p. 71). This is the spirit of modern capitalism which must be differentiated from other forms of historically existing capitalisms, which retained a traditionalistic cast. What makes modern capitalism unique and what makes traditional sorts of capitalism distinct is that “just that peculiar ethic was missing in all these cases” (p. 72).\nWeber notes that the key defining feature of the ethic exemplified in Franklyn’s maxims is that the acquisition of money comes to be defined as the supreme good, and as an end in itself; here “the acquisition of money, takes place here simultaneously with the strictest avoidance of all spontaneous enjoyment of it” and “the pursuit of riches is fully stripped of all pleasurable, and surely hedonistic, aspects” (p. 72).\nIt is in this respect that the ethic of modern capitalism constitutes an exact reversal of the traditional economic ethic. In the traditional ethic the accumulation of riches is a means to an end, which is the hedonistic enjoyment of those riches."

    "section": "8.2 The Capitalist Frame of Mind",
    "text": "8.2 The Capitalist Frame of Mind\nThe other aspect of the spirit of capitalism which breaks with traditionalism is the attitude towards work. While in the traditionalist attitude work was a burden or a means to keep people alive in the spirit of capitalism work becomes sacralized as duty to a vocation[^“Sacralization” is the process whereby something becomes holy or sacred]: “this peculiar idea of a duty to have a vocational calling, so familiar to us today but actually not at all self-evident, is the idea that is characteristic of the”social ethic” of modern capitalist culture” (p. 73).\nWhat is important is that the notion of the calling “appears regardless of the particular nature of the activity and regardless, especially, of whether this activity seems to involve…nothing more than a simple utilization of their the capacity for labor or their treatment of it as only a material possession (as “capital”) (p. 73). This is the particular frame of mind (mentality, spirit) that is characteristic of modern capitalism.\nWeber goes on to note that the development of this ethic of the calling actually predates modern rational capitalism. In fact, persons born under contemporary capitalism do not really need to have imbued this ethic, since modern capitalism functions as an objectified “casing” into which we are all born (it is thus independent of any particular cultural support). Weber sees the fact that capitalism’s basic ideas actually pre-date its full institutional maturity as a refutation of the historical materialist claim that ideas are the result of the super-structure (p. 74)."

    "section": "8.3 Economic Traditionalism",
    "text": "8.3 Economic Traditionalism\nThe development of these ideas however was not unproblematic. Weber notes (p. 74-75) that in order to prevail, this ethic of the calling as a duty had to vanquish the spirit of economic traditionalism that dominated the middle ages, where it would have been dismissed as simply “as an expression of filthy greed.” Weber rejects that idea that the reason for this is that the acquisitive spirit was less developed back then; thus the development of the acquisitive instinct is not what distinguishes modern from pre-modern capitalism.\nThus, traditional capitalism (supplemented by the moral dualism which allows unscrupulous treatment of outsiders) is quite compatible with all forms of greed. Instead, modern capitalism is actually compatible with a restraining of this acquisitive impulse and its channeling towards a permanent, methodical and ultimately rational organization of economic life.\nEconomic traditionalism is most poignantly observed in relation to the lack of effectiveness of economic incentives in the face of a traditionalist attitudes towards work and needs; when the piece rate is increased, workers tend to work less so that they can end up earning what they are accustomed to (p. 76). Weber notes that “people do not wish `by nature’ to earn more and more money. Instead, they wish simply to live, and to live as they have been accustomed and to earn as much as is required to do so” (p. 77).\nWeber rejects top-down analyses of capitalism which presume to reduce it to a particular holistic “form.” Instead, for Weber the institutional form of capitalism must be decoupled from its frame of mind (mentality, spirit). It is only when a specific frame of mind meets a modern form of organization of productive activity (in a relationship of “adequacy” not determination) that modern capitalism emerges. Historically one can find the form without the adequate frame of mind, and the frame of mind in anticipation of (and in the absence of) the organizational form.\nForms that seem modern can be managed in a “traditionalist” way; furthermore in the case of capitalism it was not the entrepreneurs of the “commercial aristocracy” who were the carriers of the frame of mind of modern capitalism. Instead it was the upwardly mobile, industrial middle classes.\nEconomic traditionalism can thus be observed at the lower levels (in the attitude towards work of those who have nothing to sell but their labor) and at the “highest” labor (in the attitude towards acquisition and business on the part of capitalists). Weber notes that the traditionalist equilibrium was upset not by the introduction of new technology or the development of new institutional frameworks or the influx of money capital but by the appearance of a new breed of capitalists endowed with a non-traditionalist frame of mind: “rather, a new spirit came into play: the spirit of modern capitalism” (p. 82).\nWho were these people? They were not,\n\n…[A]s a rule, the bold and unscrupulous speculators or the adventurous persons in pursuit of riches, such as are encountered in all epochs of economic development, have not created this transformation…Nor were the ‘great financiers’ pivotal. Rather a different group proved central: men raised in the school of hard knocks, simultaneously calculating and daring but above all dispassionate, steady, shrewd devoted fully to their cause, and in possession of strict, middle class views and ‘principles’ (p. 83)."

    "text": "8.4 Luther’s Conception of the “The Calling”\nWeber begins by noting the cultural resonance of the German word beruf, and how it is even more obvious in the English equivalent calling. The notion (specific to Protestantism and absent in Medieval Catholicism and Antiquity) that one’s work is a task entrusted upon the person by God (p. 99).\nWeber also notes the cultural novelty of the notion, attributable mainly to the reformation, although there are aspects of the notion that do appear before. What is particularly novel about the Protestant notion is the attachment of religious significance to daily work. This is different from the Classical notion that only certain types of work were morally uplifting. The Protestant notion decouples the issue of moral worth of work from the type of work that you do. Even the most menial, mind-numbing, and boring type of work could be your calling, and thus would be the way in which manifest God’s purpose for your life on earth.\nIn this way, Weber provides a motivational account (see Lecture @ref(weber-action-interests)) for how worker’s would be willing to perform what Marx (see Lecture @ref(marx-estrangement)) called alienating or estranged labor in a sustained and systematic way for their whole life. That is, by developing the notion of the calling, Luther provides people with an ideal interest (tied initially to religious salvation) to engage in work, above and beyond the material interest of staying alive (the one that Marx recognized as preponderant in modern capitalism).\nFor Weber, the notion of the calling also serves to destroy the moral dualism of Medieval Catholicism which divided ethical commandments into those which were prescribed versus those which were “advised.” In Protestantism, the entirety of the ethical commandments belong to the prescribed category, such that is everybody’s duty to lead equally ascetic lives. For Weber, this results in the “moral legitimation of vocational life” (p. 101).1\nWeber closes by noting that the basic task is not to evaluate the “substantive ideas” of the reformation by reference to social, political, or religious standards. Instead, the issue is to actually focus on seemingly peripheral “side-effects” of these ideas upon mundane matters that would otherwise escape notice. Accordingly, the main question to ask is: “Which characteristic features of our modern life and culture should be attributed to the influence of the Reformation?”\nWeber also rejects the historical materialist thesis that the reformation can be reduced to a simple after-effect of economic and technological transformations at the level of the base. For Weber, the reformation was the little superstructure that could! (change history)."
