    "section": "1.1 Why begin with Marx?",
    "text": "1.1 Why begin with Marx?\nThere are several reasons to begin with Marx. First, Marx is a representative of the transitional period in which a specifically social-scientific discourse is still struggling to differentiate itself from Philosophy. While philosophical discourses on society are as old as Plato’s Republic or Aristotle’s Politics, self consciously “scientific” discourses about society (modeled after the budding natural sciences of the day) do not emerge (in Western Europe) until the 18th century. Even then, these discourses do not reach full maturity until the middle of the nineteenth century. It would take another half-century for something like “sociology” to become institutionalized in University curricula.\nThe only figure of a comparable stature to Marx who was also struggling to create a specifically scientific discourse about society at the same time is the French philosopher Auguste Comte. Comte is in fact the originator of the term sociology, which combines a Latin first half (socius, which means society) with a Greek second half (logos, which means knowledge) The reason why we don’t begin with Comte is that Marx was actually much more successful in actually producing tangible evidence that something like an empirical sociology was possible. While Comte attempted to create an empirical sociology, his system remained much too wedded to traditional metaphysics (even though he saw his “positivist” philosophy as an attach on metaphysics).\nIn Marx, by way of contrast, we see a clearer attempt to attack the categories of Western philosophy, metaphysics and political economy as incomplete. Marx argues that the analyst must begin from empirical fact. In that respect Marx’s economic approach to history continues to be influential, while Comte’s more heavy-handed approach to history has long fallen into disfavor."

    "section": "1.2 Marx with and Against Philosophy",
    "text": "1.2 Marx with and Against Philosophy\nThis is of course not deny that Marx himself did not have strong philosophical commitments. The issue is not that Marx was not guided by those commitments, but that he felt that he also needed to point to empirical evidence to justify them. That’s what makes Marx a part of the social-scientific and not the philosophical tradition.\nWhat were the major philosophical influences on Marx? First, there is no doubt that Hegelian influences are paramount. G. F. W. Hegel is important, because he was the most influential modern philosopher to attempt to establish that history had a “logic” that could be grasped intellectually. In addition, Hegel attempted to join an abstract, philosophical theory of the origins of subjectivity in a dialectic of self and other with a theory of the way in which conceptions of the subject developed through history. In that respect, Hegel’s approach to history was heavily theoretical, teleological and “progressive.” Marx inherits all of these qualities.\nSecond, it is obvious that Marx is an heir to both the German romantic tradition and the French revolutionary tradition. In the German romantic tradition, rather than reason or rationality being the primary qualities that distinguish human from other animals, it is instead creativity that makes humans unique. Thus, creative activity (exemplified primarily by artistic and intellectual creativity but also by the creativity of the craftsman who actually molds nature into useful forms) is taken as the *model} of the most worthwhile forms of human behavior. Modern trends towards the routinization and mechanization of labor are condemned precisely because they take away the opportunity for persons to exercise creative activity. Marx’s analysis of the labor process obviously belongs to this tradition.\nFrom the French revolutionary tradition (coupled with Hegelian “progressivism”), Marx inherits a penchant to “criticize” existing institutional arrangements seen as standing in the way of the full expression of personal capacities (e.g. the organization of production under capitalism) and to formulate utopian arrangements that will liberate persons from the “shackles” of existing institutions."

    "section": "1.3 Estranged Labor",
    "text": "1.3 Estranged Labor\n\n1.3.1 Self-interest\nMarx begins by criticizing classical political economy for taking its basic categories, namely, land, labor, capital, and private property, for granted and not providing a comprehensive account of their origins and their functions. Marx also criticizes classical political economy for presupposing an exogenous set of human motivations (e.g. greed, avarice) and “the war amongst the avaricious—competition” (p. 71).\nFor Marx, greedy or selfish motivations for work and economic activity, along with the fact of competition, cannot be presupposed to be “hard-wired” into persons as a starting point for inquiry. Marx had a different theory of human nature: he thought of competition and selfishness as derivative of capitalism as an organized system. In this respect the emergence of a society of egoistic individuals competing against one another for scarce goods and the hegemony of cultural and intellectual theories that claim to derive this qualities as eternal properties of human nature must themselves be explained.\n\nFor Marx, people are just not greedy; they become greedy when embedded in a system in which greed is incentivized; competition does not just happen it must be allowed by the way in which production and exchanged are organized. ```\n\n\n\n1.3.2 The System\nMarx argues that in order for the connections between all of these factors to be understood, they must placed in the context of a wider whole or “system.” Taking any of these as exogenous begs the question as to their emergence. This apriorism makes classical (and neoclassical) economics into non-empirical, speculative “science.” In contrast to this approach, Marx proposes one in which the analyst proceeds from “empirical fact.” This last claim must of course be taken with a grain of salt. No analyst really begins from empirical fact. Instead, the construction of an analytic system requires presuppositions. Marx simply begins with different presuppositions. The difference is that he thinks his presuppositions have the added virtue of actually being supported by the relevant historical evidence, while those of classicla political economy are purely speculative.\nFor Marx, persons are not fundamentally self-interested. In fact, what makes persons unique and different for animals is the fact that naturally they take the “species” (and not their individual self) as their primary object of interest. “self-interest” is not a natural condition, but a consequence of a particular organization of production. In fact Marx argues clearly (p. 75) that it is precisely because under capitalism “man” [sic] is estranged from nature (the objects and medium of her labor) and because man is estranged from herself (in the labor process) that she comes to be focused on her individual life."

    "title": "1  Marx on Estrangement and the Labor Process",
    "section": "1.4 Alienation",
    "text": "1.4 Alienation\n\n1.4.1 Alienation From the Product of Labor\nMarx notes that the more workers produce as a class, the cheaper labor becomes. For instance, labor is cheapest in industry that produce the most “stuff” (e.g. apparel). That is, real wages can decline or stagnate even as worker productivity increases. He also notes that in this process, the very product that the laborer produces confronts the worker as itself something that is alien and that does not belong to them. Thus, the worker comes to confront the external world of objects as an alien entity that exercises a constraining power over her. This is one aspect of alienation, the “objective culture” made up of finished goods comes to swallow the human workers that participate in their production.\n\n\n1.4.2 Alienation From Activity\nIn addition to being separated and alienated from the product of their labor, the worker is also alienated from her own activity. Thus, the worker performs actions robotically and without any attachment to them. More strongly, their actions technically belongs to the capitalist, who pays for them (in the form of wages) like he does for any other factor of production. The worker thus comes to be estranged form the very act of production during the “labor process.” During work the worker is not herself, since her own activity does not “belong” to her: it belongs to the capitalist who “pays” for her labor. Thus, during work it is almost as if somebody else goes through “the motions” not the worker herself.\nAs Marx explains:\n\nWhat, then, constitutes the alienation of labour? First, the fact that labour is external to the worker, i.e., it does not belong to his essential being; that in his work, therefore, he does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical -6 and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He is at home when he is not working, and when he is working he is not at home. His labour is therefore not voluntary, but coerced; it is forced labour. It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need; it is merely a *means} to satisfy needs external to it. Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, labour is shunned like the plague. External labour, labour in which man alienates himself, is a labour of self-sacrifice, of mortification. Lastly, the external character of labour for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own, but someone else’s, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another. Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human imagination, of the human brain and the human heart, operates independently of the individual-that is, operates on him as an alien, divine or diabolical activity-in the same way the worker’s activity is not his spontaneous activity. It belongs to another; it is the loss of his self (p. 72).\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Labor under capitalism\nThe modern organization of production makes labor a means to an end. But man’s essence is to labor in a free, conscious way. That is labor is an end in itself. Laboring as a way to get something else (e.g. money or vacation) is unnatural for Marx. In the very same way “acquisitive” consumption is unnatural for Marx. He notes that private property has “made us so stupid” (p. 87) that we think that we have something only when it is possessed or directly consumed. But it is possible for something to be “ours” while at the same time being shared by others.\nPeople are different from animals in that they consciously produce their own means of subsistence. Life activity is an object of consciousness for people. Because of this, humans are the only animal that can in fact produce not for themselves, and not strictly for his or her own survival, but it can produce freely for others. Humans are the only animal that can create things that others (who are different from them) can appreciate and get a use out of.\nConsider this mystery: we have all gone shopping, and we have all found some commodity that appears to be “just for us.” How does that happen? How is it possible that somebody who has never had a direct interaction with us, is able to “guess” what we would like?\nEstranged labor thus creates a condition in which people become capable of producing only for themselves and lose their capacity and ability to produce for others. This is exemplified today in the different between planning and execution or the difference between mental and manual labor. In this division of labor the modern process of estrangement is clearly exemplified: a (small) class of producers who produce for others and a large class of producers who produce for themselves. The difference between the “real jobs” people in the “creative arts” have and their “day jobs” is also relevant here. Here we see estrangement and alienation in the same person but segregated into different times of the day or different days of the week. Production “for the species” (artistic, creative labor) is gratifying and rewarding; while “estranged production” is painful and something that can only be put up with but never truly enjoyed or found self-fulfilling.\n\n\n1.4.4 Self-estrangement and estrangement form others\nFinally, the organization of production under capitalism estranges persons from one another because it creates divisions in the social structure. For instance, if the product of my labor does not belong to me, then it belongs to somebody else. If I am not the one deciding on the “design” of the product, then someone else is. Insofar as estranged labor is a sort of distorted relation to oneself, this distorted relationship has to manifest itself in our interpersonal relations to others. Thus, insofar as the object that we produce does not belong to us and confronts us as something alien and powerful then it must belong to another person who also exerts power over us: “Every self-estrangement of man from himself and from nature appears in the relation in which he places himself and nature to men other than and differentiated from himself” (p. 78). Social divisions and the divisions between men, are thus the product of a particular organization of production.\nIn reducing work to subsistence labor and in attaching essentially competitive and selfish motivations to what should be a selfless activity, labor under capitalism estranges men from the capacity to produce freely for others, and in this (most important) respect it estranges men from the most important part of their nature, which Marx refers to as their species-being.\nOnce again, here’s is Marx:\n\nWe have considered the act of estranging practical human activity, labour, in two of its aspects. (1) The relation of the worker to the product of labour as an alien object exercising power over him. This relation is at the same time the relation to the sensuous external world, to the objects of nature as an alien world antagonistically opposed to him. (2) The relation of labour to the act of production within the labour process. This relation is the relation of the worker to his own activity as an alien activity not belonging to him; it is activity as suffering, strength as weakness, begetting as emasculating, the worker’s own physical and mental energy, his personal life or what is life other than activity-as an activity which is turned against him, neither depends on nor belongs to him. Here we have self-estrangement, as we had previously the estrangement of the thing (p. 73).\n\nPrivate property emerges as a consequence of alienated labor not its cause. The same analysis can be given of all of the other categories of political economy. Private property encapsulates both the antagonistic relation of the worker to himself (the product of his labor) as dual to the relationship between the worker and the non-worker (capitalist).\nThis is part of Marx’s attempt to turn the assumptions of classical political economy on their head. Rather than assume that persons are “naturally” selfish, selfishness is derived as a consequence of the organization of production under capitalism.Rather than assume that persons are in a natural state of competition against one another, competition is derived as a result of the estrangement of persons from one another (the third form of estrangement) under capitalism.Rather than presume that the mechanization and routinization of labor are natural, they are derived as the inevitable result of the competition for profit on the part of capitalists. Finally (and most controversially) rather than presume that private property is a primitive, the institution of private property is derived as a consequence of a class division between those who only have their wages to sell, and those who “buy” labor power in an open market."

    "section": "2.1 Finding logic in history",
    "text": "2.1 Finding logic in history\nMarx was certainly not the first, but has certainly been the most influential of the modern thinkers that has tried to understand the “logic” of history. This has been a very seductive idea in the history of social thought and has been expressed in both religious (e.g. theological) and secular formulations. For instance, on the religious side, the conception of a progression of human history from a pristine state, to the “fall” to a future redemption was dominant in the Christian West.\nIn the eighteenth century, the rise of “enlightenment” philosophy produced the first influential version of a secular theory of history progression which proclaimed the past (the medieval dark ages) as an epoch ruled by error and superstition and saw the future as one of progress governed by reason. This is why the period is classically known as “The Age of Reason.”\nWith Marx the notion of a logic of history passes from philosophical speculation into the realm of social science. The faith that human history follows a decipherable logic makes Marx a “progressive” thinker. This contrasts to thinkers who see history as simply a random collection of events with no rhyme or reason or those who see history as following a logic, but one of decline rather than progress.\nMarx acquired the penchant of understanding human historical progress through a conceptual lens offered by Hegelian philosophy. In Hegel, history could be understood as the gradual progression of cultural “epochs” or periods. These periods were characterized by the dominance of particular conceptions or ideas which defined social relationships, institutions and even religious notions. Hegel’s mature philosophy came to be perceived as a “conservative” ideology for the fledgling unification government in Germany. For Hegel the “logic” of the history of ideas and political and social forms “culminated” in the aristocratic quasi-democracy of the Prussian state.\nMarx was part of a group of intellectuals in Germany in the 1830s and 1840s that came to be known as the Young Hegelians. These intellectuals rejected the conservative cast of official Hegelianism while retaining the basic conceptual apparatus. Some of the young Hegelians used Hegel’ own dialectical method and his reflections on the origins of subjectivity as a form of “alienation” to mount a radical attack against traditional Christianity.\nMarx, like the rest of the young Hegelians was enthusiastic about the “critical” project, but he rejected the residual idealism of Ludwig Feuerbach (the most influential of the Young Hegelians), for a sociologically flavored concern with how persons “produce” their being as part of attempting to subsist. Marx also retained the ambition to understand the logic that governed the transition from one historical period to the next.\nMarx’s most lasting innovation is his proposition that the “logic” of historical progression lies not in ideas or cultural forms, but in concrete and very much material “modes” for the organization of economic production. This follows from his rock-bottom assumption that the essence of human beings (what makes them different from animals) is the capacity to produce their own mode of subsistence. For Marx, it was innovation and revolutions at the level of the productive forces (productive technology and the relations of production characteristic of an epoch) in which the secret to understanding the logic of history could be found."

They are the material forces that generate production. These include tools, machinery, technology, factories, etc.\nThe relations of production are the relations in which persons enter into in order to produce their means of subsistence (e.g. wage labor, serfdom, slavery, cooperation, etc.).\n\nPolitical and legal institutions are designed to regulate both the acceptable ways of organizing production and even the acceptable uses of technology for the production of goods as well as the forms of the distribution, exchange and consumption of goods.\nFinally, ideology and forms of consciousness emerge to make sense of and justify some existing way of organizing production."

    "section": "2.3 Understanding Historical Change",
    "text": "2.3 Understanding Historical Change\nMarx emphasizes that in order to understand the progression of historical stages, we must understand economic development. That is, because society is the result of reciprocal action among persons any one individual cannot choose the form of society that he she lives in. This means that a given state of the productive “forces” or faculties general fixes the form of commerce and consumption of society. Production, commerce and consumption in their turn fixes the constitution of civil society (e.g. politics, family life, classes, etc.).\nPersons do not choose the productive forces of the society, and they can do very little to alter them as individuals. Historically, men are born into and encounter a certain state of the productive forces of society which serve as a constraint and as a point of departure for further development. The productive forces determine the type of material relations that men can enter into with another, and “[t]heir material relations are the basis of all their relations. These material relations are only the necessary forms in which their material and individual activity are realized” (p. 137).\nEconomic relations are secondary to the particular state of development of the productive forces. Once there is a change in the specific material mode in which men produce their subsistence, the older economic institutions and the social relations premised upon them must change (“burst”) in turn. Thus, Marx explains the demise of the medieval guild system in England as a result of the technological development and the expansion of commercial activity: “…as men [sic] develop their productive faculties, that is, as they live, they develop certain relations with one another…the nature of these relations must necessarily change with the change and growth of the productive faculties” (p. 140).\nTo each economic epoch, Marx notes there exist a particular coupling between a given way of organizing production (a “division of labor”) and a particular state of technology. These are concrete historical forms and not abstract a-temporal “economic categories.” Thus, for Marx, there is no such thing as “The Division of Labor” in general or “machinery” in general, but specific forms of the division of labor (which correspond to a given state of development of the productive forces of a given society) or a specific state of development of productive technology. To state otherwise is to commit the idealistic fallacy of reification of historical realities into abstract economic forms.\nFor Marx, persons produce not only material products, but they produce the social relations under which production takes place and they produce they idea with which they make sense of and legitimize a given organization of production. There is no dualism between material and ideal, since both are the product of human activity."

These is the thesis of correspondence between relations of production and productive forces.\n“The sum total of these relations of production constitute the economic structure of society.” Economic structure = relations of production + productive forces.\nThe economic structure of society is the “real” foundation upon which a “superstructure” composed of legal and political institutions and “forms of social consciousness” rests.\n“The mode of production [economic structure] of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual process in general” (p. 4).\nThis is the thesis of the conditioning role of the economic structure in relation to the superstructure.\n\n\n\n2.4.2 The base/superstructure conflict-model of historical change\n\n“At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production, or—what is but a legal expression of the same thing—with the property relations within which they have been at work hitherto” (p. 4).\nThis is the thesis of the uneven development of the productive forces in relation to the relations of production and the superstructure.\nIn a certain respect Marx is arguing that the productive forces change at a faster rate than the relations of production and the legal arrangement that support them both of which tend to lag behind.\nThese now obsolete relations of production are not only lagging behind, but begin to constitute an impediment to the further development of the productive forces: “…these relations turn into their fetters” (p. 4-5).\nThis situation can only be resolved through a revolutionary change in which new relations of production are devised which better “fit” the new forces of production.\n“Then begins an epoch of social revolution. With the change of economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed” (p. 5).\nMarx argues that technological transformations should be kept distinct from its accompanying “ideological”, legal or cultural transformations. The former “can be determined with the precision of natural science,” while the latter tend to (presumably) be much more slippery, messy and harder to pin down.\nMarx did not think that looking at cultural transformations was a good way to estimate whether a period of revolution was on its way; instead it is more accurate to look at “the contradictions of material life” especially the tensions between “productive forces” and “relations of production.”\nIn this respect Marx makes two observations:\n\n\nFirst, “no social order ever perishes before all the productive forces for which there is room in it have developed” (p. 5).\nSecond, “new, higher relations of production never appear before the material conditions of their existence have matured in the womb of the old society itself” (p. 5)."
